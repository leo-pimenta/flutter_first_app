# test_app

First Flutter App - created for studies.

This app is very simple and was created following Google's Flutter first app tutorial.

The app is a list view of random generated names (The tutorial call them Startup names). There is some stylization, colors changed. Also, there is a "favorite list" that introduces the concept of navigation through different pages, as well as the stack concept of the page navigation.

Flutter uses the language "Dart". The dart files can be found at: /lib. They are:

- main.dart;
- Favorites.dart;
- FavoritesState.dart;
- RandomWords.dart;
- RandomWordStates.dart;

There are some small differences from the tutorial. I've also separated every class in it's own file, which made necessary some additional coding.
